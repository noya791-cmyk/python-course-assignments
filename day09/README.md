Day 09 Report — What we do with the data

- Read `subjects.txt` and parse submission subjects, student names, and timestamps.
- Identify which students submitted which day(s) and record the earliest submission per student/day.
- Infer deadlines (or load them from a provided JSON) and flag late submissions.
- Produce timing distribution (hours relative to deadline), peak activity windows, and per-hour counts.
- Compute completion rate for specified milestones and list students missing milestones.

Graphical representations (ASCII examples)

Timing Distribution example:  [##########                    ] 25.0%  -> proportion of submissions in a bucket
Peak Activity example:       [##############                ] 33.0%  -> when (time-of-day) most submissions occurred
Completion Rate example:     [####                            ] 10.0%  -> percent of class completed all milestones

Notes:
- The ASCII bars are generated by the script (`report.py`) and help visualize proportions directly in the terminal.
- Provide a `--deadlines-file` JSON to set exact deadlines, or rely on the script's heuristic.
