# Day03 PCR Calculator

## Changes from Day02

- Removed the GUI file and the previous README for a more streamlined, script-focused version.
- Retained only the core calculator (`pcr_calculator.py`), CLI interface (`pcr_calculator_cli.py`), and the test script (`test_pcr_calculator.py`).
- All code improvements from Day02 are included:
  - Multiple polymerase presets (Q5®, Phusion®, Taq, Platinum™ II)
  - Input validation for reaction number and parameters
  - Template DNA calculation from concentration
  - Adjustable primer concentration and reaction volume
  - CLI with robust error handling and argument support
  - Comprehensive test script for validation

This folder is intended for users who want to use or test the PCR calculator via command line or scripts, without the graphical interface.
