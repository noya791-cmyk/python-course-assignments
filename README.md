# Day 01 – Website Creation Assignment

## ChatGPT Version Used
GPT-5 (ChatGPT, November 2025)

## Project Description
This task was part of the Python course assignments, aiming to create a simple personal website hosted on GitHub Pages.

The website includes:
- A personal profile section with a portrait photo.  
- Basic information about me, my studies, and my research.  
- Links to my Weizmann Institute profile and lab page.  
- A clean and professional green-themed design with icons.

## Prompts Summary
Below are the main prompts I used to generate and refine the website code with ChatGPT:

1. "Help me visually improve my GitHub website"  
   → ChatGPT suggested ideas for better layout, colors, and content sections.

2. "Add personal information about me"  
   → I provided my age, location, and academic background to include in the site.

3. "Use a soft green color palette with professional icons"**  
   → ChatGPT updated the HTML and CSS styling for a clean, soft green aesthetic.

4. "Integrate my uploaded image into the site"  
   → ChatGPT finalized the `index.html` code, linking to `images/0212007066.JPG`.

## Outcome
The final result is a personal academic webpage built from scratch using HTML and CSS, hosted on GitHub Pages.  
It includes personalized content, consistent design, and simple interactivity.
